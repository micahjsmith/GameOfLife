GameOfLife
==========

A java applet to "play" Conway's legendary Game of Life.
Conceived by the mathematician John Conway, the "rules" of the game, per Wikipedia, go as follows:

  1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
  2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
  3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
  4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
    
This can lead to some very complex emergent patterns.

Click or drag on the grid to add or remove cells. Change the speed of the animation with the slider -- or,
see generations one at a time using next. Save a specific pattern and watch it reappear when you reset the grid.

Features that may be implemented in the future:
  - View the number of generations that have elapsed in real time
  - Right click on a cell to add one of many pre-defined, interesting patterns, like gliders or spaceships.
